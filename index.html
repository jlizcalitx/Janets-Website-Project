    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p> Although the name implies these pups come from <b>Australia</b>, their origin is unknown. They get their name due to being associated with Basque shepherd dogs, who come from the Basque region of Spain. Basque shepherds first took their dogs with them to Australia before immigrating to the US. Their breed was developed later on in the US.
